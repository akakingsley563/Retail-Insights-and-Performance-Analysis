### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing customer demographics and sales performance for a retail business. Using Power BI, we created comprehensive dashboards that provide insights into the business's key metrics, customer behavior, and sales trends. The data includes customer information, sales records, and order details from various regions and customer segments.

## Aim

This will help the business understand its customer base, identify top-performing products and regions, and ultimately make data-driven decisions to enhance profitability and customer satisfaction.
